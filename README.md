# Peter-Parking-System

The main goal of this project is to get hands on experience of using Database Systems by applying them to a real world scenario. Here I have tried to create a basic application of simulating a day-praking system (Parking available only for a single day).

Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/

Install PostgreSQL from https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

After installaltion set system environment variables for both.

Clone this repository.

Create the relations as described in database.sql file in Postgre SQL.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

To start the server run `npm start`.

The Front end is an mobile application developed using flutter for which the link is as below.
Repo link for mobile application: https://github.com/Peter-Parking-System/User-Screens
